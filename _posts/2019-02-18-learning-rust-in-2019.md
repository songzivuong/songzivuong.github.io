I plan to learn Rust in this year.

{% include toc %}

## Why

The [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/) gives three reasons of why you should learn the Rust programming language:

1. Performance

    > Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.

2. Reliability

    > Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — and enable you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.

3. Productivity

    > Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.

Other reasons:

- Rust has been the most loved language for three consecutive years (2016~2018) in the [Stack Overflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/) results.

## How

First, read ["the book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). Besides, Jim Blandy's book [*Programming Rust*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920040385.do) is also a good reference with high ratings both at [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25550614-programming-rust) and at [Douban](https://book.douban.com/subject/26616762/).

Feel boring to a lot of words? [Rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/).

### Read the Core Documentation

- [The Rust Standard Library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html)
- [The Edition Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/index.html)
- [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html)
- [The Rustdoc Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/index.html)
- [The Rustc Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/index.html)
- [Rust Compiler Error Index](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html)

### Build Your Skills in an Application Domain

- [Command Line Applications in Rust](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/cli-wg/)
- [Rust and WebAssembly](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/)
- [The Embedded Rust Book](https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/)

### To Be a Master

- [The Rust Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/index.html)
- [The Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/index.html)
- [The Unstable Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/index.html)

## Project

I have make a [GitHub project](https://github.com/users/songzivuong/projects/22) to track my study path.
