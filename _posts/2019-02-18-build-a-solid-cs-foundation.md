I didn't learn computer science or programming in a systematic way. My major in college was Applied Physics. Now, I have been a programmer for 4 years. It's time to up level: from a coder to a [*computer scientist*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist) or a [*software engineer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineer).

This plan is mostly inspired by [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).
