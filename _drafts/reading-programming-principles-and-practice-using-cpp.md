## The Structure of This Book

- Part I. *The Basics*: type system, arithmetic operations, control structures, error handling, and the design, implementation, and use of functions and user-defined types.
- Part II. *Input and Output*: how to present numeric data, text, and geometric shapes as graphical output, and how to get input into a program from a graphical user interface.
- Part III. *Data and Algorithms*: focuses on the C++ standard libraryâ€™s containers and algorithms framework.
- Part IV. *Broadening the View*: matrix computation, text manipulation, testing, and embedded systems programming.

Each chapter contains a section named "Review". I believe that reading these review questions at first is a good strategy to read this book. It would let you check how much knowledge already known to yourself. If you meet an unfamiliar point, you can go back to the main text to find the description of it. I believe this method could make you to be an active reader.
